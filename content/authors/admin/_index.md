Mazen Soufi is an assistant professor of information science at <a href="http://icb-lab.naist.jp/english/index.html">Imaging-based Computational Biomedicine lab</a> in Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST). My research focuses on the analysis of disease progression trends based on features dervied from multi-modality medical images (such as MRI, CT or histopathology images). In my work, I use deep learning-based image segmentation algorithms to extract the target organs/structures and perform downstream analysis.<br>
I worked before in projects involving range image-based approaches for monitoring head and neck cancer patients during raditation therapy, prognostic prediction of lung cancer patients using CT image features, and liver fibrosis grading in MR images based on statistical shape analysis. I'm currently interested in the analysis of musculoskeletal (MSK) structures to have insights into the age- and disease-related variations. To pursue this goal, I collaborate with multiple healthcare/medical institutions in Japan and abroad to analyze large-scale (x10,000s volumetric images) databases. I finally aim at developing novel image biomarkers to be used in improving our understanding of aging and disease of the MSK system.<br>
I primiarly use python and the mainstream deep learning frameworks (Tensorflow, PyTorch, MONAI) with the main medical image analysis and visualization libraries (VTK, ITK, Elastix) in my reseach.<br>
Besides my research, I serve as a reviewer for multiple journals and conferences (domestic and international), including <a href="http://www.miccai.org/">MICCAI</a>, <a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/home/">Heliyon (Cell)</a>, <a href="https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15269914">Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics</a>, <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/mta"> ITE Transactions on Media Technology and Applications</a>, and <a href="https://abe-journal.org/">Advanced Biomedical Engineering</a>.
