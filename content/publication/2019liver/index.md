abstract: Purpose- Liver shape variations have been considered as feasible indicators of liver fibrosis. However, current statistical shape models (SSM) based on principal component analysis represent gross shape variations without considering the association with the fibrosis stage. Therefore, we aimed at the application of a statistical shape modelling approach using partial least squares regression (PLSR), which explicitly uses the stage as supervised information, for understanding the shape variations associated with the stage as well as predicting it in contrast-enhanced MR images.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
