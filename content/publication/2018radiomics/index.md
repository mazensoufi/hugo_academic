abstract: Purpose- To identify the optimal mother wavelets in survival prediction of lung cancer patients using wavelet decomposition-based (WDB) radiomic features in CT images.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study has revealed the potential of Symlet and Biorthogonal mother wavelets in  the survival prediction of lung cancer patients by using WDB radiomic features in CT images.
