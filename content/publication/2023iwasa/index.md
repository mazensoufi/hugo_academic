abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have enabled precise three-dimensional analysis of individual muscles on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance images via automatic segmentation. This study aimed to perform three-dimensional assessments of pelvic and thigh muscle atrophy and fatty degeneration in patients with unilateral hip osteoarthritis using CT and to evaluate the correlation with health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
